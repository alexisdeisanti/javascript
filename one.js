// Write a script that will alert the user how many 
// puppies are left based on the number of puppies and tigers present.

// You may want to create a variable for number of puppies, 
var puppies = 20;
// a variable for number of tigers,
var tigers = 10; 
// and a variable for number of puppiesLeft, which calculates
var puppiesLeft = puppies - tigers;
// the number of puppies minus the number of tigers.

// Then alert to the user a message that indicates how many puppies are left.
alert(puppiesLeft)
